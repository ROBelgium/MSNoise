qc_components,Z,"Components to process for QC, defaults to [Z], but can be any comma separated list (e.g. 'Z,E,N')",str,
qc_ppsd_length,3600.0,Length of data segments passed to psd in seconds. In the paper by McNamara et al (2004) a value of 3600 (1 hour) was chosen. Longer segments increase the upper limit of analyzed periods but decrease the number of analyzed segments.,float,
qc_ppsd_overlap,0.0,"Overlap of segments passed to psd. Overlap may take values between 0 and 1 and is given as fraction of the length of one segment, e.g. `qc_ppsd_length=3600` and `qc_ppsd_overlap=0.5` result in an overlap of 1800s of the segments.",float,
qc_ppsd_period_smoothing_width_octaves,0.125,Determines over what period/frequency range the psd is smoothed around every central period/frequency. Given in fractions of octaves (default of ``1`` means the psd is averaged over a full octave at each central frequency).,float,
qc_ppsd_period_step_octaves,0.0125,Step length on frequency axis in fraction of octaves (default of ``0.125`` means one smoothed psd value on the frequency axis is measured every 1/8 of an octave).,float,
qc_ppsd_period_limits,"(0.01,100)","Set custom lower and upper end of period range (e.g. ``(0.01, 100)`` seconds). The specified lower end of period range will be set as the central period of the first bin (geometric mean of left/right edges of smoothing interval). At the upper end of the specified period range, no more additional bins will be added after the bin whose center frequency exceeds the given upper end for the first time.",eval,
qc_ppsd_db_bins,"(-200, -50, 1.)",Specify the lower and upper boundary and the width of the db bins. The bin width might get adjusted to fit a number of equally spaced bins in between the given boundaries.,eval,
qc_rms_frequency_ranges,"[(1.0, 20.0), (4.0, 14.0), (4.0, 40.0), (4.0, 9.0)]",Specify the frequency bounds (in Hz) to compute the RMS from PSDs,eval,
qc_rms_type,DISP,What units do you want for the exported RMS,str,DISP/VEL/ACC
