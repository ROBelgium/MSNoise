""" This code is responsible for the computation of the cross-correlation
functions.

This script will group *jobs* marked "T"odo in the database by day and process
them using the following scheme. As soon as one day is selected, the
corresponding jobs are marked "I"n Progress in the database. This allows
running several instances of this script in parallel.

Waveform Pre-processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pairs are first split, and a station list is created. The database is then
queried to get file paths. For each station, all files potentially containing
data for the day are opened. The traces are then merged and split, to obtain
the most continuous chunks possible. The different chunks are then demeaned,
tapered and merged again to a 1-day-long trace. If a chunk is not aligned
on the sampling grid (that is, start at a integer times the sample spacing in s)
, the chunk is phase-shifted in the frequency domain. This requires tapering and
fft/ifft. If the gap between two chunks is small, compared to a configurable
value (``preprocess_max_gap``), the gap is filled with interpolated values.
Larger gaps will not be filled with interpolated values.

.. warning::
    As from MSNoise 1.5, traces are no longer padded by or merged with 0s.

Each 1-day long trace is then high-passed (at ``preprocess_highpass`` Hz),
then if needed low-passed (at ``preprocess_lowpass`` Hz) and
decimated/downsampled. Decimation/Downsampling are configurable
(``resampling_method``) and users are advised testing Decimate. One advantage of
Downsampling over Decimation is that it is able to downsample the data by any
factor, not only integer factors. Downsampling can be achieved with the new
ObsPy Lanczos resampler.

If configured, each 1-day long trace is corrected for its instrument response.
Currently, only dataless seed and inventory XML are supported.

As from MSNoise 1.5, the preprocessing routine is separated from the compute_cc
and can be used by plugins with their own parameters. The routine returns a
Stream object containing all the traces for all the stations/components.

Processing
~~~~~~~~~~

Once all traces are preprocessed, station pairs are processed sequentially.
If a component different from *ZZ* is to be computed, the traces are first
rotated. This supposes the user has provided the station coordinates in the
*station* table. The rotation is computed for Radial and Transverse components.

Then, for each ``corr_duration`` window in the signal, and for each filter
configured in the database, the traces are clipped to ``windsorizing`` times
the RMS (or 1-bit converted) and then whitened in the frequency domain
(see :ref:`whiten`) between the frequency bounds. The whitening procedure can be
skipped by setting the ``whitening`` configuration to `None`. The two other
``whitening`` modes are "[A]ll except for auto-correlation" or "Only if
[C]omponents are different". This allows skipping the whitening when, for
example, computing ZZ components for very close by stations (much closer than
the wavelength sampled), leading to spatial autocorrelation issues.

When both traces are ready, the cross-correlation function is computed
(see :ref:`mycorr`). The function returned contains data for time lags
corresponding to ``maxlag`` in the acausal (negative lags) and causal
(positive lags) parts.

Stacking and Saving Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If configured (setting ``keep_all`` to 'Y'), each ``corr_duration`` CCF is
saved to the hard disk. By default, the ``keep_days`` setting is set to True
and so "N = 1 day / corr_duration" CCF are stacked and saved to the hard disk
in the STACKS/001_DAYS folder.

.. note:: Currently, the keep-all data (every CCF) are not used by next steps.

If ``stack_method`` is 'linear', then a simple mean CCF of all windows is saved
as the daily CCF. On the other hand, if ``stack_method`` is 'pws', then
all the Phase Weighted Stack (PWS) is computed and saved as the daily CCF. The
PWS is done in two steps: first the mean coherence between the instantaneous
phases of all windows is calculated, and eventually serves a weighting factor
on the mean. The smoothness of this weighting array is defined using the
``pws_timegate`` parameter in the configuration. The weighting array is the
power of the mean coherence array. If ``pws_power`` is equal to 0, a linear
stack is done (then it's faster to do set ``stack_method`` = 'linear'). Usual
value is 2.

.. warning:: PWS is largely untested, not cross-validated. It looks good, but
    that doesn't mean a lot, does it? Use with Caution! And if you
    cross-validate it, please let us know!!

    of weak, coherent signals through phase-weighted stacks". Geophysical
    Journal International 130, 2 (1997): 497-505.

Once done, each job is marked "D"one in the database and, unless ``hpc`` is
``Y``, STACK jobs are inserted/updated in the database.

To run this script:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ msnoise compute_cc


This step also supports parallel processing/threading:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ msnoise -t 4 compute_cc

will start 4 instances of the code (after 1 second delay to avoid database
conflicts). This works both with SQLite and MySQL but be aware problems
could occur with SQLite.


.. versionadded:: 1.4
    The Instrument Response removal & The Phase Weighted Stack &
    Parallel Processing

.. versionadded:: 1.5
    The Obspy Lanczos resampling method, gives similar results as the
    scikits.samplerate package, thus removing the requirement for it.
    This method is defined by default.

.. versionadded:: 1.5
    The preprocessing routine is separated from the compute_cc and can be called
    by external plugins.

.. versionadded:: 1.6
    The ``preprocess_max_gap`` parameter.
    The ``hpc`` parameter that can prevent the automatic creation of STACK jobs.
