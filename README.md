MSNoise is the first complete software package for computing and monitoring relative velocity variations using ambient seismic noise. 
MSNoise is a fully-integrated solution that automatically scans data archives and determines which jobs need to be done whenever the scheduled task is executed. 

MSNoise is developed by Thomas Lecocq (Royal Observatory of Belgium, ROB) and Corentin Caudron (previously at ROB and EOSingapore, now at University of Cambridge).
The group of active users (providing questions, feedback, snippets of code) is growing and the full list of Contributors is available here: http://msnoise.org/doc/contributors.html. 


History
-------

* 2010: MSNoise is based on Matlab, c++, csh and fortran codes developped at ISTerre/Univ. Grenoble and IPGP in the framework of the [ERC Whisper project](https://whisper.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/).
* 2011/12: MSNoise is tested on Undervolc data, and used by Corentin for his PhD thesis.
* 2013: First release of MSNoise for the IAVCEI 2013 in Kagoshima ([Release Notes](http://msnoise.org/doc/releasenotes/msnoise-1.0.html)).
* 2014: Improvements and bugfixes, release 1.2.5. Publication of the [SRL article](http://srl.geoscienceworld.org/content/85/3/715.full) ([Release Notes](http://msnoise.org/doc/releasenotes/msnoise-1.2.5.html)).
* 2015: MSNoise 1.3: MSNoise is real python package, with a documented API and new plots ([Release Notes](http://msnoise.org/doc/releasenotes/msnoise-1.3.html)).
* 2016: MSNoise 1.4: new web admin interface, plugin support, instrument response removal and phase weighted stacking ([Release Notes](http://msnoise.org/doc/releasenotes/msnoise-1.4.html)).
* 2017: MSNoise 1.5: Autocorrelation / Single Station correlation support, rewritten preprocessing, new_jobs and scan_archive for more performance, better instrument response preloading ([Release Notes](http://msnoise.org/doc/releasenotes/msnoise-1.5.html)).
