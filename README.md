MSNoise is the first complete software package for computing and monitoring relative velocity variations using ambient seismic noise. 
MSNoise is a fully-integrated solution that automatically scans data archives and determines which jobs need to be done whenever the scheduled task is executed. 

MSNoise is a joint project of the Royal Observatory of Belgium (Thomas Lecocq and Corentin Caudron) and ISTerre + IPGP (Florent Brenguier)
