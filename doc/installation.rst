Installation
------------
MSNoise is a python package that uses a database (sqlite or MySQL) for storing
station and files metadata together with jobs. When installed, it provides a top
level command ``msnoise`` in the console.

To run MSNoise, you need:

* A recent version of Python (3.x recommended). We suggest using Anaconda_
  with a few extra modules. MSNoise is tested "continuously" by automatic
  build systems (TravisCI and Appeveyor) for **Python 2.7** and **Python 3.5**,
  on **Windows, Linux and MacOSX** 64 bits systems!

  * Those modules are already distributed with Anaconda_:

    * setuptools
    * numpy
    * scipy
    * pandas
    * matplotlib
    * statsmodels
    * sqlalchemy
    * click
    * flask
    * pymysql
    * wtforms

  * Not shipped with Anaconda_:

    * obspy
    * flask-admin
    * markdown
    * folium
    * flask-wtf


* MySQL: if you want to use MySQL, you need to install and configure a
  MySQL Server beforehand. This is not needed for sqlite.
  Read :ref:`aboutdbandperformances` for more information.
  We recommend using MySQL.


Full Installation
-----------------

1. Download and install Anaconda_ for your machine, make sure Anaconda's Python
   is the default python for your user

2. Execute the following command to install the missing packages:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

        pip install flask-admin flask-wtf markdown folium
        conda install -c conda-forge obspy

3. Install a MySQL server and MySQL Workbench:

   Download and install MySQL Community Server (MySQLs_ ) and MySQL Workbench
   (MySQLw_ ) ; On Windows one can also use the MySQL installer (MySQLi_ ).

   On Linux, the MySQL server can also be installed using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo apt-get install mysql-server

4. Create a privileged user and a database:

   * Start MySQL Workbench and connect to the local database
   * Click on "Privileges" and create a new user, with all privileges (Select
     all). Ideally, create user "msnoise" with password "msnoise".

5. Install the latest release version of MSNoise:

   .. code-block:: sh

        pip install msnoise

   Power user could install the development version too, but it is not
   recommended.

6. Check which required packages you are still missing by executing the
   ``msnoise bugreport`` command. (See :ref:`testing`)

7. To be sure all is running OK, one could start the ``msnoise test`` command
   in an empty directory. This will start the standard MSNoise test suite, which
   should end with a "Ran xx tests in yy seconds : OK".

8. Proceed to the :ref:`Workflow` description to start MSNoise!

Done !

MySQL Server and Workbench
--------------------------

Using the MySQL Server and Workbench is fairly easy and lots of tutorials are
available online as text or videos.

Once both are installed, start Workbench and you should see the local MySQL
server automatically identified:

.. image:: .static/workbench_1.png

And by clicking on "Local Instance ..." another tab should open, connected to
the local database.

Create a msnoise user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select "Users and Privileges" in the left sidebar, then "Add Account". Define
the username and the password (msnoise:msnoise could do, although "weak"):

.. image:: .static/workbench_2.png

Then, under "Administrative Roles", grant this user the *DBA* mode (user can
perform all tasks on the database server) and click "Apply".

.. image:: .static/workbench_3.png


.. _emptydb:

Create an empty database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each "project" needs a database. That is, if one has two different volcanoes and
wants to run MSNoise the two datasets, one needs to create two empty databases.

Click on the "Create new schema" button in the taskbar:

.. image:: .static/workbench_4.png

and give the database a name (for example msnoise; or msnoise_project1, or
project1, or else, you choose) ; and click "Apply":

.. image:: .static/workbench_5.png

and click "Apply" again and it should state all is OK:

.. image:: .static/workbench_6.png

.. image:: .static/workbench_7.png

When done, the database we created is present in the left sidebar:

.. image:: .static/workbench_8.png

And you're ready to start your first project: :ref:`Workflow`.


When moving your project to a larger server, HPC or else, just add the
connection to this server in Workbench and you're good to go with the very
same interface/tool !


Database Structure Â–- Tables
----------------------------
MSNoise will create the tables automatically upon running the installer script
(see :ref:`Workflow`).


Building this documentation
---------------------------

To build this documentation, some modules are required:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install sphinx
    pip install sphinx_bootstrap_theme
    
Then, this should simply work:

.. code-block:: sh

    make html
    
it will create a .build folder containing the documentation.

You can also build the doc to Latex and then use your favorite Latex-to-PDF
tool.


Using the development version
-----------------------------

This is not recommended, but users willing to test the latest development
(hopefully stable) version of MSNoise can:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip uninstall msnoise
    pip install http://msnoise.org/master.zip

Please note this version most probably uses the very latest version of every
package: Release versions of `numpy`, `scipy`, etc obtained from conda-forge
and "master" version of `obspy`. The development version (master) of obspy can
be installed from github:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip uninstall obspy
    pip install https://github.com/obspy/obspy/archive/master.zip

If you are using the master version, please use the issue tracker of github to
communicate about bugs and not the mailing list, preferably used for Releases.
