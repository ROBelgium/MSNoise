Reprocess data
--------------

When starting to use MSNoise, one will most probably need to re-run different
parts of the Workflow more than one time. By default, MSNoise is designed to
only process "what's new", which is antagonistic to what is wanted. Hereafter,
we present cases that will cover most of the re-run techniques:


When adding a new filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If new filter are added to the filters list in the Configurator, one has to
reprocess all CC jobs, but not for filters already existing. The recipe is:

* Add a new filter, be sure to mark 'used'=1
* Set all other filters 'used' value to 0
* Redefine the flag of the CC jobs, from 'D'one to 'T'odo with the following:
* Run ``msnoise reset CC --all``
* Run ``msnoise compute_cc``
* Run next commands if needed (stack, mwcs, dtt)
* Set back the other filters 'used' value to 1

The compute_cc will only compute the CC's for the new filter(s) and
output the results in the STACKS/ folder, in a subfolder named by a formatted
integer from the filter ID. For example: STACKS/01 for 'filter id'=1, STACKS/02
for 'filter id'=2, etc.


When changing the REF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When changing the REF, the REF stack has to be re-computed:

``msnoise stack -r -i 999`` will ensure all jobs marked done in the last 999
days are checked for modification. The REF will then be re-output.



When changing the MWCS parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MWCS parameters are changed in the database, all MWCS jobs need to be
reprocessed.


``msnoise reset DTT --all``

``msnoise compute_mwcs``

shoud do the trick.


When changing the dt/t parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``msnoise compute_dtt -i 999`` will ensure all MWCS jobs marked done in the
last 999 days are checked for modification.



Define one's own data structure of the waveform archive
-------------------------------------------------------

The data_structure.py file contains the known data archive formats. If another
data format needs to be defined, it will be done in the ``custom.py`` file
in the current project folder:

.. seealso:: Check the "Populate Station Table" step in the :doc:`workflow`.

Testing the Dependencies
------------------------

Once installed, you should be able to import the python packages in a python console. 
MSNoise comes with a little script called `bugreport.py` that can be useful
to check if you have all the required packages (+ some extras).

The usage is such:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ msnoise bugreport -h

    usage: msnoise bugreport [-h] [-s] [-m] [-e] [-a]
    
    Helps determining what didn't work
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -s, --sys      Outputs System info
      -m, --modules  Outputs Python Modules Presence/Version
      -e, --env      Outputs System Environment Variables
      -a, --all      Outputs all of the above


On my Windows machine, the execution of 

.. code-block:: sh

    $ msnoise bugreport -s -m

results in:

.. code-block:: sh

    Not required, just checking:

    [X] distutils: 2.7.5
    [X] IPython: 1.0.0
    [X] vtk: present (no version)

The [X] marks the presence of the module. In the case above, PyQt4 is missing, but that's not a problem because
`wx` or `PySide` are present, so traitsui has a backend to render the GUI for the Configurator. The "not-required"
packages are checked for information, those packages can be useful for reporting / hacking / rendering the data.

To install a missing package, for example *obspy*, use the pip command:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install obspy
