master
======

Major:
* added support for Location IDs: TODO + add documentation
* this CHANGES the structure of the database !! TODO should we provide an "upgrade" tool?
* changes to the schema: Station (and TODO Filter too)
* supprort for PostgreSQL databases. TODO: check if removing index_hints really affect performances (should not)

Changes:
 - msnoise
  * drop Continuous Integrations for Python 2.7. Only test on 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9
  * support for Location codes: TODO
  * PostgreSQL support

 - msnoise.admin:
  * changed the visualisation of the config table, allows filtering names,
    shows modified/new values, definition and enum values
  * when a type or enum is defined, the field in the Edit Form view is set to a
    select box/date picker to avoid wrong choices.

 - msnoise.api:
  * preload_instrument_response now reads anything
    obspy.inventory.read_inventory can read
  * preload_instrument_response() returns either a pandas.DataFrame or and
    Inventory object (should eventually be default)
  * get_next_job() now allows setting a max number of returned job (useful
    when processing many stations/pairs for a limited number of days in
    parallel on multiple cores).
  * get_results() TODO
  * get_results_all() now returns an empty DataFrame if there are no data
  * check_stations_uniqueness(): helper function to determine if a station
    that was provided is lacking the location code. If there is only one
    possible case, returns it, otherwise #TODO fails.

 - msnoise.commands
  * execute: allows to export the result of a SELECT query to a CSV dataframe
  * update_loc_chan: updates the `used_location_codes` and `used_channel_names`
    from the SEED IDs available in the database, for each NET.STA (station
    table)

 - msnoise.compute_cc
  * added possibility to echange the clipping (winsorizing) and spectral
    whitening steps using the new `clip_after_whiten`. Note: requires an extra
    pair of ifft/fft on the whitened data if set to Y.

 - msnoise.compute_mwcs:
  * the code now gets the ref and current data from the API and don't do I/O
    directly. TODO this will allow replacing the storage format without changing
    the code of the different steps.

 - msnoise.default:
  * now the default config bits are stored in a CSV file, with name, default
    value, definition, type, and enum values
  * the default.default dict is an AttribDict containing all information
  * deprecated bits: "autocorr", TODO: response_format?

 - msnoise.doc:
  * added how-to for checking the instrument response
  * TODO add documentation for the QC package

 - msnoise.new_jobs:
  * added support for LOC IDs
  * if a Station has multiple `used_location_codes` defined, those will be
    treated like different stations. E.g. if we have 2 stations: BE.UCC and
    BE.MEM BE.MEM has "00,10" configured, and data has been found for those LOC
    by scan_archive, the new_jobs step will create three cross-station jobs:
    BE.MEM.00:BE.MEM.10, BE.MEM.00:BE.UCC.--, BE.MEM.10:BE.UCC:--

 - msnoise.plots:
  * all plots have been adapted to fetch NET.STA.LOC(.CHAN)
  * if the LOC code is not provided for a plot, the API checks if there is only
    one solution and returns it, otherwise fails.
  * data_availability: now shows the availability for each SEED id present in
    the database
  * distance: TODO: check interstation distances for different LOC

 - msnoise.preprocessing:
  * replaced "stream.simulate" by "stream.remove_response"
  * added supoort for the LOC IDs

 - msnoise.qc: #TODO ALL DOCUMENTATION PAGES
  * new group, commands (TODO temporary naming): compute_psd, plot_psd
  * computes PPSD using obspy, saves daily NPZ and PNG files in SDS-like
    structure
  * new parameters in the database (PSD length, overlap, and smoothing
    parameters, see obspy's doc for PPSD.__init__)
  * added documentation TODO

- msnoise.scan_archive:
  * added support for the LOC IDs. If it is "" (=empty), the record is added to
    the data_availability table with the "--" loc value.
  * the scan procedure will apply the global network and channel selectors (from
    the config table), then apply the per-station selectors defined in
    `used_location_codes` and `used_channel_names`. If empty, scan_archive will
    scan all possible ("*") LOC IDs and add them to the database.

 - msnoise.table_def:
  * Station: get new fields: `used_location_codes` and `used_channel_names`
  * Filter: TODO remove the rms_threshold parameter


1.6.x
